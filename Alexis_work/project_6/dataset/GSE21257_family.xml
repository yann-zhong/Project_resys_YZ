Osteosarcoma tissue was snap-frozen in 2-Methylbutane (Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, the Netherlands) and stored at -70°C. Using a cryostat, 20 µm sections from each block were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin to ensure at least 70% tumor content and viability. RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), followed by RNA clean-up using the QIAGEN Rneasy mini kit (Venlo, the Netherlands) with on-column DNAse treatment, according to manufacturers instructions. RNA quality and concentration were measured using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Santa Clara, CA, USA) and Nanodrop ND-1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), respectively.

    <Description>
Gene expression data were exported from BeadStudio version 3.1.3.0 (Illumina) in GeneSpring probe profile format.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data were analyzed using the statistical language R. As Illumina identifiers are not stable and consistent between different chip versions, raw oligonucleotide sequences were converted to nuIDs. Data were transformed using the variance stabilizing transformation (vst) algorithm and subsequently normalized using robust spline normalization. Conversion to nuIDs, variance stabilizing transformation, and normalization of the data were all carried out using the Bioconductor package lumi. Quality control was performed using the Bioconductor package arrayQualityMetrics. Two supplementary/raw files are present, because each array that represents one sample consists of 2 chips. The supplementary/raw data files represent the bead level data (2 raw .txt files per sample, containing all intensities per bead).

Osteosarcoma tissue was snap-frozen in 2-Methylbutane (Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, the Netherlands) and stored at -70°C. Using a cryostat, 20 µm sections from each block were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin to ensure at least 70% tumor content and viability. RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), followed by RNA clean-up using the QIAGEN Rneasy mini kit (Venlo, the Netherlands) with on-column DNAse treatment, according to manufacturers instructions. RNA quality and concentration were measured using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Santa Clara, CA, USA) and Nanodrop ND-1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), respectively.

    <Description>
Gene expression data were exported from BeadStudio version 3.1.3.0 (Illumina) in GeneSpring probe profile format.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data were analyzed using the statistical language R. As Illumina identifiers are not stable and consistent between different chip versions, raw oligonucleotide sequences were converted to nuIDs. Data were transformed using the variance stabilizing transformation (vst) algorithm and subsequently normalized using robust spline normalization. Conversion to nuIDs, variance stabilizing transformation, and normalization of the data were all carried out using the Bioconductor package lumi. Quality control was performed using the Bioconductor package arrayQualityMetrics. Two supplementary/raw files are present, because each array that represents one sample consists of 2 chips. The supplementary/raw data files represent the bead level data (2 raw .txt files per sample, containing all intensities per bead).

Osteosarcoma tissue was snap-frozen in 2-Methylbutane (Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, the Netherlands) and stored at -70°C. Using a cryostat, 20 µm sections from each block were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin to ensure at least 70% tumor content and viability. RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), followed by RNA clean-up using the QIAGEN Rneasy mini kit (Venlo, the Netherlands) with on-column DNAse treatment, according to manufacturers instructions. RNA quality and concentration were measured using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Santa Clara, CA, USA) and Nanodrop ND-1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), respectively.

    <Description>
Gene expression data were exported from BeadStudio version 3.1.3.0 (Illumina) in GeneSpring probe profile format.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data were analyzed using the statistical language R. As Illumina identifiers are not stable and consistent between different chip versions, raw oligonucleotide sequences were converted to nuIDs. Data were transformed using the variance stabilizing transformation (vst) algorithm and subsequently normalized using robust spline normalization. Conversion to nuIDs, variance stabilizing transformation, and normalization of the data were all carried out using the Bioconductor package lumi. Quality control was performed using the Bioconductor package arrayQualityMetrics. Two supplementary/raw files are present, because each array that represents one sample consists of 2 chips. The supplementary/raw data files represent the bead level data (2 raw .txt files per sample, containing all intensities per bead).

Osteosarcoma tissue was snap-frozen in 2-Methylbutane (Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, the Netherlands) and stored at -70°C. Using a cryostat, 20 µm sections from each block were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin to ensure at least 70% tumor content and viability. RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), followed by RNA clean-up using the QIAGEN Rneasy mini kit (Venlo, the Netherlands) with on-column DNAse treatment, according to manufacturers instructions. RNA quality and concentration were measured using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Santa Clara, CA, USA) and Nanodrop ND-1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), respectively.

    <Description>
Gene expression data were exported from BeadStudio version 3.1.3.0 (Illumina) in GeneSpring probe profile format.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data were analyzed using the statistical language R. As Illumina identifiers are not stable and consistent between different chip versions, raw oligonucleotide sequences were converted to nuIDs. Data were transformed using the variance stabilizing transformation (vst) algorithm and subsequently normalized using robust spline normalization. Conversion to nuIDs, variance stabilizing transformation, and normalization of the data were all carried out using the Bioconductor package lumi. Quality control was performed using the Bioconductor package arrayQualityMetrics. Two supplementary/raw files are present, because each array that represents one sample consists of 2 chips. The supplementary/raw data files represent the bead level data (2 raw .txt files per sample, containing all intensities per bead).

Osteosarcoma tissue was snap-frozen in 2-Methylbutane (Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, the Netherlands) and stored at -70°C. Using a cryostat, 20 µm sections from each block were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin to ensure at least 70% tumor content and viability. RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), followed by RNA clean-up using the QIAGEN Rneasy mini kit (Venlo, the Netherlands) with on-column DNAse treatment, according to manufacturers instructions. RNA quality and concentration were measured using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Santa Clara, CA, USA) and Nanodrop ND-1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), respectively.

    <Description>
Gene expression data were exported from BeadStudio version 3.1.3.0 (Illumina) in GeneSpring probe profile format.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data were analyzed using the statistical language R. As Illumina identifiers are not stable and consistent between different chip versions, raw oligonucleotide sequences were converted to nuIDs. Data were transformed using the variance stabilizing transformation (vst) algorithm and subsequently normalized using robust spline normalization. Conversion to nuIDs, variance stabilizing transformation, and normalization of the data were all carried out using the Bioconductor package lumi. Quality control was performed using the Bioconductor package arrayQualityMetrics. Two supplementary/raw files are present, because each array that represents one sample consists of 2 chips. The supplementary/raw data files represent the bead level data (2 raw .txt files per sample, containing all intensities per bead).

Osteosarcoma tissue was snap-frozen in 2-Methylbutane (Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, the Netherlands) and stored at -70°C. Using a cryostat, 20 µm sections from each block were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin to ensure at least 70% tumor content and viability. RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), followed by RNA clean-up using the QIAGEN Rneasy mini kit (Venlo, the Netherlands) with on-column DNAse treatment, according to manufacturers instructions. RNA quality and concentration were measured using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Santa Clara, CA, USA) and Nanodrop ND-1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), respectively.

    <Description>
Gene expression data were exported from BeadStudio version 3.1.3.0 (Illumina) in GeneSpring probe profile format.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data were analyzed using the statistical language R. As Illumina identifiers are not stable and consistent between different chip versions, raw oligonucleotide sequences were converted to nuIDs. Data were transformed using the variance stabilizing transformation (vst) algorithm and subsequently normalized using robust spline normalization. Conversion to nuIDs, variance stabilizing transformation, and normalization of the data were all carried out using the Bioconductor package lumi. Quality control was performed using the Bioconductor package arrayQualityMetrics. Two supplementary/raw files are present, because each array that represents one sample consists of 2 chips. The supplementary/raw data files represent the bead level data (2 raw .txt files per sample, containing all intensities per bead).

Osteosarcoma tissue was snap-frozen in 2-Methylbutane (Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, the Netherlands) and stored at -70°C. Using a cryostat, 20 µm sections from each block were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin to ensure at least 70% tumor content and viability. RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), followed by RNA clean-up using the QIAGEN Rneasy mini kit (Venlo, the Netherlands) with on-column DNAse treatment, according to manufacturers instructions. RNA quality and concentration were measured using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Santa Clara, CA, USA) and Nanodrop ND-1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), respectively.

    <Description>
Gene expression data were exported from BeadStudio version 3.1.3.0 (Illumina) in GeneSpring probe profile format.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data were analyzed using the statistical language R. As Illumina identifiers are not stable and consistent between different chip versions, raw oligonucleotide sequences were converted to nuIDs. Data were transformed using the variance stabilizing transformation (vst) algorithm and subsequently normalized using robust spline normalization. Conversion to nuIDs, variance stabilizing transformation, and normalization of the data were all carried out using the Bioconductor package lumi. Quality control was performed using the Bioconductor package arrayQualityMetrics. Two supplementary/raw files are present, because each array that represents one sample consists of 2 chips. The supplementary/raw data files represent the bead level data (2 raw .txt files per sample, containing all intensities per bead).

Osteosarcoma tissue was snap-frozen in 2-Methylbutane (Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, the Netherlands) and stored at -70°C. Using a cryostat, 20 µm sections from each block were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin to ensure at least 70% tumor content and viability. RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), followed by RNA clean-up using the QIAGEN Rneasy mini kit (Venlo, the Netherlands) with on-column DNAse treatment, according to manufacturers instructions. RNA quality and concentration were measured using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Santa Clara, CA, USA) and Nanodrop ND-1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), respectively.

    <Description>
Gene expression data were exported from BeadStudio version 3.1.3.0 (Illumina) in GeneSpring probe profile format.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data were analyzed using the statistical language R. As Illumina identifiers are not stable and consistent between different chip versions, raw oligonucleotide sequences were converted to nuIDs. Data were transformed using the variance stabilizing transformation (vst) algorithm and subsequently normalized using robust spline normalization. Conversion to nuIDs, variance stabilizing transformation, and normalization of the data were all carried out using the Bioconductor package lumi. Quality control was performed using the Bioconductor package arrayQualityMetrics. Two supplementary/raw files are present, because each array that represents one sample consists of 2 chips. The supplementary/raw data files represent the bead level data (2 raw .txt files per sample, containing all intensities per bead).

Osteosarcoma tissue was snap-frozen in 2-Methylbutane (Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, the Netherlands) and stored at -70°C. Using a cryostat, 20 µm sections from each block were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin to ensure at least 70% tumor content and viability. RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), followed by RNA clean-up using the QIAGEN Rneasy mini kit (Venlo, the Netherlands) with on-column DNAse treatment, according to manufacturers instructions. RNA quality and concentration were measured using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Santa Clara, CA, USA) and Nanodrop ND-1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), respectively.

    <Description>
Gene expression data were exported from BeadStudio version 3.1.3.0 (Illumina) in GeneSpring probe profile format.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data were analyzed using the statistical language R. As Illumina identifiers are not stable and consistent between different chip versions, raw oligonucleotide sequences were converted to nuIDs. Data were transformed using the variance stabilizing transformation (vst) algorithm and subsequently normalized using robust spline normalization. Conversion to nuIDs, variance stabilizing transformation, and normalization of the data were all carried out using the Bioconductor package lumi. Quality control was performed using the Bioconductor package arrayQualityMetrics. Two supplementary/raw files are present, because each array that represents one sample consists of 2 chips. The supplementary/raw data files represent the bead level data (2 raw .txt files per sample, containing all intensities per bead).

    <Summary>
High-grade osteosarcoma is a malignant primary bone tumor with a peak incidence in puberty. Overall survival of patients with metastatic disease is approximately twenty percent. Mechanisms behind the development of metastases in osteosarcoma are unknown. To identify gene signatures that play a role in metastasis, we performed genome-wide gene expression profiling on pre-chemotherapy biopsies of osteosarcoma patients who developed metastases within 5yrs and patients who did not develop metastases within 5yrs.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Pre-chemotherapy biopsies of osteosarcoma patients who developed metastases within 5yrs (n=34) were compared with pre-chemotherapy biopsies of osteosarcoma patients who did not develop metastases within 5yrs (n=19).
