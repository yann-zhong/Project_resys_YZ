# Introduction
The project starts off simply with the installation of the required packages.
First, we make sure BiocManager is installed, which is a necessity for pretty much every subsequent bioinfo package we will be using next.
Then, we install RTN (for inferring regulatory network), snow (for parallel processing in RTN), and finally RedeR for visualization. We also install limma to allow for model and DE analysis of our data.a

For preprocessing, we install Biobase and GEOquery for base functions in Bioconductor and accessing GEO data respectively.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Installation of required packages, only run if not installed yet

# RTN for inferring the regulatory network based on the downloaded gene expression data
# snow for parallel processing in RTN
# RedeR for better visualization of inferred network

if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

# For main code
BiocManager::install("RTN")
BiocManager::install("snow")
BiocManager::install("RedeR")
BiocManager::install("limma")

# For preprocessing
BiocManager::install("Biobase")
BiocManager::install("GEOquery")

```

Activate libraries (and open documentation for RTN, RedeR and limma)

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Load required libraries and open vignettes
# (A vignette is a long-form guide to your package.)
library(igraph)
library(RTN)
library(snow)
library(RedeR)
library(limma)
browseVignettes('RTN')
browseVignettes('RedeR')
browseVignettes('limma')
# Note: no vignettes for snow, use snow.pdf found at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/snow/index.html 

# For preprocessing
library(Biobase)
library(GEOquery)


```

# Preprocessing, as provided in the Slack channel
We get the necessary files remotely and put them inside data objects in our environment.
We do some stuff on the data(?) and throw into gset to run exp and log functions (?)

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# load series and platform data from GEO

Sys.setenv("VROOM_CONNECTION_SIZE" = 131072 * 2) # to prevent size connection error on getGEO
readr::local_edition(1)                          # to prevent row.names error on getGEO

gset <- getGEO("GSE21257", GSEMatrix =TRUE, AnnotGPL=FALSE) 
# get GEO data from notebook; gset is a list with one element inside; GSE21257_series_matrix.txt.gz. This one element contains all the info from the osteosarcoma paper.
if (length(gset) > 1) idx <- grep("GPL10295", attr(gset, "names")) else idx <- 1 
# If there is more than one element inside gset, we look for the indexes of those that have "GPL10295" in the name, and put the number of indexes inside idx; here we only have one.
gset <- gset[[idx]]     # Keep all elements matching out "name" criteria

# log2 transform
ex <- exprs(gset)       # Get matrix of standard deviation
exprs(gset) <- log2(ex) # set all elements to log2
```

# Get the gene names:
(Download full table here https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GPL10295)
Or simply present in the MINiML files as "GPL10295-tbl-1.txt", which we need to add the header to from this link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?view=data&acc=GPL10295&id=10175&db=GeoDb_blob44

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
annotation <- read.csv(file = 'GPL10295-tbl-1.txt', skip = 7, sep = '\t') 
# Read file skipping first 7 (commented ) lines
gexpIDs <- annotation[,c('ID', 'Illumina_Gene', 'Symbol')]
# Creates a gexpIDs variable and put ID, ILlumina_Gene and Symbol columns inside
```

# Start RTN, with preprocessing
Of note: the tni constructor serves to create rtni, which is a TNI class object.
As according to documentation: the constructor requires a list with 3 objects: a named gene expression matrix (ex), a vector listing genes regarded as TFs (tfs) and a data frame with gene annotations (gexpIDs).

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#DEBUGGING

library(RTN)
data(tniData)
#data(dt4rtn_TFs)

tfs <- read.table("dt4rtn_TFs.txt")
tfs = setNames(tfs$V2, tfs$V1) # by default V1 and V2 are
names(tfs) -> bkp
tfs <- annotation$ID[match(names(tfs), annotation$Symbol)]
tfs <- as.character(tfs)
names(tfs) <- bkp

tfs <- tfs[-which(is.na(tfs))]

rtni <- tni.constructor(expData=ex, regulatoryElements=tfs, rowAnnotation=gexpIDs, cvfilter=T)
```

# RTN main body, and visualization
We infer the RTN by running a permutation function with at least 1000 runs. This takes a fair amount of time. Then, both the unstable interactions as well as the weak interactions are removed by use of bootstraping and ARACNE respectively, and regulon information is displayed.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

# Infer an RTN by permutation analysis, with 1000 permutations
rtni <- tni.permutation(rtni, nPermutations = 1000)
# Remove unstable interactions
rtni <- tni.bootstrap(rtni)
# Run ARACNE to remove weakest interactions in any triplet
rtni <- tni.dpi.filter(rtni)
# Regulon information
tni.regulon.summary(rtni)

```

Here are numerous... failed attempts to export the rtni object so that this doesn't have to be run again in case we accidentally clear the global environment.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

#write.table(rtni, file = "rtni.txt", sep = "\t")
#write.csv(rtni, file = "rtni.csv")

library(readr)
#write_tsv(rtni, file = "rtni.txt")
#write_csv(rtni, file = "rtni.csv")

```

Plot out the network using all the regulons' names as a parameter - rather than the 5 that are given as a tutorial.
Then, we use RedeR to visualize the inferred network. 

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

# Create an object comprised of all regulons
regulons <- tni.get(rtni, what = "regulons.and.mode", idkey = "SYMBOL")
head(regulons$AEBP1)
#head(regulons$AFF3)
#head(regulons$AR)

save.image(file = "rtni_backup.RData")

# With all elements:
g <- tni.graph(rtni, regulatoryElements = names(regulons))
# With list of top 10 hits:
g <- tni.graph(rtni, regulatoryElements = c("ZNF91","ZNF264","YEATS4","TRPS1","SOX2","PAX7","MYCN","IRF7","IRF8","HIF1A"))

rdp <- RedPort()
calld(rdp)
addGraph(rdp, g, layout=NULL)
addLegend.color(rdp, g, type="edge")
addLegend.shape(rdp, g)
relax(rdp, ps = TRUE)

```
